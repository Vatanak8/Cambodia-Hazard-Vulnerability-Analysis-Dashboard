# 🇰🇭 Cambodia Hazard Vulnerability Analysis Dashboard 📊

## Introduction:
This repository hosts a comprehensive Power BI dashboard designed to provide stakeholders with in-depth insights into community well-being and resilience in Cambodia. Leveraging data from 2014 to 2019, this dashboard is a multi-level analysis tool that examines vulnerability and resilience dynamics at the national, province, commune, and even village levels, offering a comprehensive understanding of Cambodia's social and environmental landscape.

## Data Source:
The data used for this project was sourced from the Cambodia National Committee for Sustainable Development (NCSD) Data Portal. This dataset is the foundation for the entire project analysis, providing reliable and comprehensive information for assessing vulnerability indices across Cambodia. **Available Here: [Data Portal](https://ncsd.moe.gov.kh/dcc/data-portal).**


## Initiatives Tracked:
At the heart of this dashboard lies the meticulous tracking of Cambodia's Vulnerability Index. This index, comprised of four key components: Storm, Flood, Drought, and Composite, reflects the complex interplay of environmental, social, and economic factors affecting community resilience. By analyzing these indices at multiple levels, stakeholders can gain insights into localized vulnerabilities and devise targeted interventions to strengthen community resilience across Cambodia.

### Vulnerability Index Components:
- **Storm Index**: Measures the susceptibility of Cambodian communities to storm-related events, such as cyclones and typhoons.
- **Flood Index**: Tracks the vulnerability of areas in Cambodia to flooding incidents, which can have devastating effects on infrastructure and livelihoods.
- **Drought Index**: Evaluates the risk and impact of drought conditions on local populations, including agricultural productivity and water availability.
- **Composite Index**: A comprehensive index specific to Cambodia, integrating multiple factors to assess overall vulnerability.

## Purpose and Impact:
The dashboard serves as a beacon of knowledge and insight for stakeholders ranging from policymakers and government agencies to NGOs and researchers in Cambodia. By providing a detailed analysis at multiple levels (national, province, commune, and village), decision-makers can better understand vulnerabilities and effectively tailor interventions to support vulnerable communities. Moreover, by empowering communities with localized data, the dashboard fosters community-driven resilience-building efforts, ensuring sustainable development outcomes.

### Key Features:
- 📈 **Interactive Visualizations**: Dive deep into the data with interactive charts, maps, and graphs highlighting vulnerability indices at various levels.
- 🔍 **Dynamic Filters**: Customize your analysis by province, commune, village, year, and vulnerability index to uncover localized trends and patterns.
- 📅 **Data Span and Granularity**: Explore trends from 2014 to 2019 and drill down to the village level for a granular understanding of vulnerability dynamics.
- 💡 **Insights for Action**: Analyze high-risk areas and trends, enabling stakeholders to formulate targeted solutions and recommendations for community resilience and sustainable development.

## Next Steps and Future Directions:
As we continue to evolve this dashboard, our focus remains on driving positive change and supporting sustainable development efforts in Cambodia. Here are some key areas of focus for future enhancements:

- 🤝 **Enhanced Community Engagement**: Foster greater community involvement and empowerment by incorporating feedback mechanisms and participatory approaches into the dashboard.
- 🌐 **Integration with External Datasets**: Expand the scope of the dashboard by integrating external datasets on socio-economic indicators, climate data, and infrastructure development to provide a more comprehensive understanding of vulnerability and resilience factors at all levels.
- 🔮 **Predictive Analytics**: Develop predictive models to forecast future vulnerability scenarios based on historical data, enabling proactive risk management and adaptation planning.

We invite you to explore this dashboard and engage with the data to gain valuable insights into Cambodian communities' vulnerability and resilience dynamics at the national, province, commune, and village levels. Together, let's work towards Cambodia's more resilient and sustainable future.
